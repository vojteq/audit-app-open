# Audit App

Project created as Bachelor Thesis in cooperation with
[Gyanoo](https://github.com/Gyanoo)
[rosKacper](https://github.com/rosKacper)
[tkozyra](https://github.com/tkozyra)

The purpose of the application is to help manage and track the progress of audit and control tasks in the corporation. It is also possible to download simple reports, which unfortunately does not work on the heroku hosting system.

You can try project demo [here](https://audit-trn-client.herokuapp.com/zaloguj) with credentials<br>
